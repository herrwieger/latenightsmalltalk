License

    i declare that all parts of Susie, as released my me, to be in
    the Public Domain.

    Why? Susie is based on Public Domain Smalltalk (PDST) which in
    turn is based on Little Smalltalk Version 3. Both of these were
    released as Public Domain. It only seems right to me, to give as
    i was given.

Public Domain  (http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/license-list.html)

    Being in the public domain is not a license--rather, it means
    the material is not copyrighted and no license is needed.
    Practically speaking, though, if a work is in the public domain,
    it might as well have an all-permissive non-copyleft free software
    license. Public domain status is compatible with the GNU GPL. 


Public domain software  (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html)

    Public domain software is software that is not copyrighted. If the
    source code is in the public domain, that is a special case of
    non-copylefted free software , which means that some copies or
    modified versions may not be free at all.

    In some cases, an executable program can be in the public domain
    but the source code is not available. This is not free software,
    because free software requires accesibility of source code.
    Meanwhile, most free software is not in the public domain; it is
    copyrighted, and the copyright holders have legally given permission
    for everyone to use it in freedom, using a free software license.

    Sometimes people use the term `public domain'' in a loose fashion
    to mean `free'' or `available gratis.'' However, `public domain''
    is a legal term and means, precisely, `not copyrighted''. For clarity,
    we recommend using `public domain'' for that meaning only, and using
    other terms to convey the other meanings.

    Under the Berne Convention, which most countries have signed, anything
    written down is automatically copyrighted. This includes programs.
    Therefore, if you want a program you have written to be in the public
    domain, you must take some legal steps to disclaim the copyright on it;
    otherwise, the program is copyrighted.
